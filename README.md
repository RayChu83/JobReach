<h2>üìú Project description</h2>
<p>JobReach is an online platform where you can discover 100+ different jobs, filter and apply to positions based on your specific requirements, showcase your most recent work experiences & more. The final product can be seen <a href="https://jobreach.vercel.app">here</a>.</p>
<h2>üîç My approach</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>1. Create the project identity</strong></li>
  <p> The first step in my approach was deciding upon a name for the project. Once choosing the name "JobReach", I proceeded to create a color palette based on color theory to best represent the projects identity.</p>
  <li><strong>2. Asset creation</strong></li>
  <p>Following the created project identity guidelines, I designed the necessary visual assets which includes the logo and the favicon. </p>
  <li><strong>3. Designing the User Interface for Static Components</strong></li>
  <p>Next, I designed the user interface for the static components, including the hero section, the contact page & more.</p>
  <li><strong>4. Establish a connection to the backend</strong></li>
  <p>Afterwards I integrated the front end with the back end. I implemented 9 unique REST API endpoints supporting various HTTP methods to handle data manipulation within a MongoDB database. With this connection, I worked on the user interface for the dynamically fetched pages.</p>
  <li><strong>5. Implement Next Authentication</strong></li>
  <p>Lastly I designed the blueprint for the entire application, determining which routes should be protected and which should remain unprotected. I utilized NextAuth.js for user authentication and, finally, created a profile page for authenticated users.</p>
</ul>
